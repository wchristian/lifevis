=head1 NAME

Win32::Process::Info::PT - Provide process information via Proc::ProcessTable.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This package fetches process information on a given machine, using Dan
Urist's B<Proc::ProcessTable>. This makes the 'Win32::' part of our name
bogus, but lets one use the same basic interface under a wider range of
operating systems.

 use Win32::Process::Info
 $pi = Win32::Process::Info->new (undef, 'PT');
 $pi->Set (elapsed_as_seconds => 0);	# In clunks, not seconds.
 @pids = $pi->ListPids ();	# Get all known PIDs
 @info = $pi->GetProcInfo ();	# Get the max

CAVEAT USER:

This package does not support access to a remote machine,
because the underlying API doesn't. If you specify a machine
name (other than '', 0, or undef) when you instantiate a
new Win32::Process::Info::PT object, you will get an exception.

This package is B<not> intended to be used independently;
instead, it is a subclass of Win32::Process::Info, and should
only be called via that package.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The main purpose of the Win32::Process::Info package is to get whatever
information is convenient (for the author!) about one or more
processes. GetProcInfo (which see) is therefore the most-important
method in the package. See it for more information.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, modules, variables, and so
on are considered private. That is, the author reserves the right
to make arbitrary changes in the way they work, without telling
anyone. For subroutines, variables, and so on which are considered
public, the author will make an effort keep them stable, and failing
that to call attention to changes.

Nothing is exported by default, though all the public subroutines are
exportable, either by name or by using the :all tag.

The following subroutines should be considered public:

=item @info = $pi->GetProcInfo ();

This method returns a list of anonymous hashes, each containing
information on one process. If no arguments are passed, the
list represents all processes in the system. You can pass a
list of process IDs, and get out a list of the attributes of
all such processes that actually exist. If you call this
method in scalar context, you get a reference to the list.

What keys are available depend on the variant in use. With the PT
variant you can hope to get at most the following keys. The caveat is
that the Win32::Process::Info keys are derived from
Proc::ProcessTable::Process fields, and if your OS does not support the
underlying field, you will not get it. Here are the possible keys and
the fields from which they are derived:

    CreationDate: start
    Description: cmndline
    ExecutablePath: fname (note 1)
    KernelModeTime: stime (note 2)
    Name: basename (fname)
    Owner: '\' . getpwuid (uid) (note 3)
    OwnerSid: uid (note 4)
    ParentProcessId: ppid
    ProcessId: pid
    UserModeTime: utime (note 2)

Notes:

1) ExecutablePath may not be an absolute pathname.

2) We assume that Proc::ProcessTable::Process returns stime and utime in
microseconds, and multiply by 10 to get clunks. This may be wrong under
some operating systems.

3) Owner has a backslash prefixed because Windows returns domain\user. I
don't see a good way to get domain, but I wanted to be consistent (read:
I was too lazy to special-case the test script).

4) Note that under Cygwin this is B<not> the same as the Windows PID,
which is returned in field 'winpid'. But the Subprocesses method needs
the ProcessId and ParentProcessId to be consistent, and there was no
documented 'winppid' field.

The output will contain all processes for which information was
requested, but will not necessarily contain all information for
all processes.

The _status key of the process hash contains the status of
GetProcInfo's request(s) for information. In the case of
Win32::Process::Info::PT, this will always be 0, but is provided
to be consistent with the other variants.

This subroutine returns a list of all known process IDs in the
system, in no particular order. If called in list context, the
list of process IDs itself is returned. In scalar context, a
reference to the list is returned.
