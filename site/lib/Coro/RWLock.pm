=head1 NAME

Coro::RWLock - reader/write locks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Coro;

 $lck = new Coro::RWLock;

 $lck->rdlock; # acquire read lock
 $lck->unlock; # unlock lock again

 # or:
 $lck->wrlock; # acquire write lock
 $lck->tryrdlock; # try a readlock
 $lck->trywrlock; # try a write lock


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements reader/write locks. A read can be acquired for
read by many coroutines in parallel as long as no writer has locked it
(shared access). A single write lock can be acquired when no readers
exist. RWLocks basically allow many concurrent readers (without writers)
OR a single writer (but no readers).

You don't have to load C<Coro::RWLock> manually, it will be loaded 
automatically when you C<use Coro> and call the C<new> constructor.
